This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
resultsOriginal <- read.csv(file = 'results.csv')
results <- resultsOriginal
freq <- as.data.frame(table(results$RID))
freq <- filter(freq, Freq==32)
results <- filter(results, RID %in% freq$Var1)
best <- apply(results,1, function(x) x[6 + x[5]])
worst <- apply(results,1, function(x) x[6 + x[6]])
best_freq <- as.data.frame(table(best))
worst_freq <- as.data.frame(table(worst))
r <- data.frame(num=1:16, result = best_freq$Freq - worst_freq$Freq)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
